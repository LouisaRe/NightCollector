### Game Proposal Version 2:



#### Problem of Version 1

You can nearly not loose the game, since you can evade the bomb very easily.



#### Proposed Solution

- Keep bomb

- Each time, you miss a star (meaning: star reaches the bottom of the screen and gets deleted from the scene):

  - reduce a life

  - play a sound

  - Graphical change, slightly change the background-color (more reddish)

- Add a Power-Up, which gives additional life
  - add life
  - play a sound
  - slightly change background-color (less reddish)
- Increase game-speed during set time intervals (e.g. every 30 seconds):
  - link game speed with the music speed



#### ToDos for Version:

- [X]  Change some core game logic parts
- [X]  Create graphic-asset for life power-up
- [x]  Find/Create sound-asset for life power-up
- [x] Define and tweak the difficulty parameters of the game:
  - [x]  Target game duration: 1 to 5 minutes?
  - [x]  => set time-interval for game speed increase
  - [x]  => set starting game speed
- [ ] Create a simple End Screen
  - [X] 1 to 3 stars
    - [ ] Each reached star: blend in after 1s and play a sound (bling-sound, each one higher than the previous one)
         <img src="ToDos.assets/stars_idea.jpg" alt="stars_idea" style="zoom:25%;" />
  - [ ]  Show reached time
  - [ ]  Maybe show "No star!" / "Yeah, ok!" / "Great score!" / "Awesome, 3 stars!!", depending on reached stars
  - [x]  incl. Winning/Loosing sound => load asynchronously
- [ ] Write README.md



## Optional for Version 2:

- [ ] Show high-score-list and save newest score to disk

  - [ ] Ask for player-name

  - [ ] Show score list:

             ..
             ..
